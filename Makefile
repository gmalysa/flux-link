# Because nodeunit has structural problems, you have to copy coverage.js into the nodeunit reporters installed
# folder, which is generally /usr/lib/node_modules/nodeunit/lib/reporters. The reporter path is given relative
# to where the executable runs from in nodeunit/bin, because nodeunit has no interest in fixing paths for you.

# You need node-jscoverage installed, or this will produce an error. That can be accomplished with:
# git clone https://github.com/visionmedia/node-jscoverage.git
# ./configure && make && make install
# Then, you'll be able to do `make coverage`

# Copy ./coverage.js to <<nodeunit install path>>/lib/reporters
